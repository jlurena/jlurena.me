        "Launched a service in which underpayments from users were identified,  users would be notified, and balance collected. At most, over $5MM of underpayments per year can be recovered\n",
        "Delivered a massive project that single handedly  changed the fundamental relationship between the users  and their benefits (products, ie Virtual Mental Health visits, a user has access to).  This allowed about 25% of users, to retain a single login account for all of their benefits,  despite the multiple benefits the user may have had from Teladoc Health's multiple acquisitions.  It also set the pavement for better new/extension of client contracts,  as well as smarter and improved scalable integrations with all of Teladoc Health's acquisitions\n",
        "Facilitated major improvements to one of our major codebase that reduced the  boilerplate code necessary to service newly acquired whitelabeled/branded clients. This resulted  in reduced development time from 2-3 months to 1-2 months,  thus servicing new clients up to two months faster\n"
